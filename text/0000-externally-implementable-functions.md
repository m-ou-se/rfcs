# Summary

A mechanism for defining a function whose implementation can be defined (or overridden) in another crate.

Example 1:

```rust
// core::panic:

extern impl fn panic_handler(_: &PanicInfo) -> !;

// user:

impl fn core::panic::panic_handler(_: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}
```

Example 2:

```rust
// log crate:

extern impl fn logger() -> Logger {
    Logger::default()
}

// user:

impl fn log::logger() -> Logger {
    Logger::to_stdout().with_colors()
}
```

# Motivation

We have several items in the standard library that are overridable/definable by the user crate.
For example, the (no_std) `panic_handler`, the global allocator for `alloc`, and so on.

Each of those is a special lang item with its own special handling.
Having a general mechanism simplifies the language and makes this functionality available for other crates, and potentially for more use cases in core/alloc/std.

# Explanation

A function can be defined as "externally implementable" using `extern impl` as follows:

```rust
// In crate `x`:

// Without a body:
extern impl fn a();

// With a body:
extern impl fn b() {
    println!("default impl");
}
```

Another crate can then provide (or override) the implementation of these functions using `impl fn` syntax (using their path) as follows:

```rust
// In another crate:

impl fn x::a() {
    println!("my implementation of a");
}

impl fn x::b() {
    println!("my implementation of b");
}
```

# Details

## Signature

It is an error to have a different signature for the `impl fn` item

## No impl

It is an error to have no `impl fn` item (in any crate) for an `extern impl fn` item without a body.

## Duplicates

It is an error to have multiple `impl fn` items (across all crates) for the same `extern impl fn` item.

## Visibility

`extern impl fn` items can have a visibility specifier (like `pub`), which determines who can *call* the function (or create pointers to it, etc.).

*Implementing* the function can be done by any crate that can name the item.

# Implementation

The implementation will be based on the same mechanisms as used today for the `panic_handler` and `#[global_allocator]` features.

The compiler of the root crate will find the implementation of all externally implementable functions and give an error
if more than one implementation is found for any of them.
If none are found, the result is either an error, or, if the `extern impl fn` has a default body, an implementation
is generated that calls that default body.

# Drawbacks

- It encourages globally defined behaviour.
  - Counterargument: We are already doing this anyway, both inside the standard library (e.g. panic_handler, allocator)
    and outside (e.g. global logger). This just makes it much easier (and safer) to get right.

# Rationale and alternatives

- The syntax re-uses existing keywords. Alternatively, we could:
  - Use the `override` reserved keyword.
  - Add a new (contextual) keyword (e.g. `existential fn`).
  - Use an attribute (e.g. `#[extern_impl]`) instead.

# Prior art

[RFC 2494 "Existential types with external definition"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2492)
has been proposed before, which basically does this for *types*. Doing this for functions (as a start) saves a lot of complexity.

# Unresolved questions

- What should the syntax be once we stabilize this?
- How should this work in dynamic libraries?

# Future possibilities

- Doing this for `static` items too. (Perhaps all items that can appear in an `extern "Rust" { â€¦ }` block.)
- Using this mechanism in the standard library to make more parts overridable. For example:
  - Allowing custom implementations of `panic_out_of_bounds` and `panic_overflowing_add`, etc.
    (The Rust for Linux project would make use of this.)
  - Allowing overriding `write_to_stdout` and `write_to_stderr`.
    (This enables custom testing frameworks to capture output. It is also extremely useful on targets like wasm.)
- This could possibly be extended to groups of functions in the form of a `trait` that can be globally implemented.
  (E.g. `extern impl AsyncRuntime`, to say that there must be a global implementation of that trait.)
